# Web Development Project 4 - Pokemon API

Submitted by: Amelia Trevino

Description: This Pokemon API connects to the PokiAPI to grab a variety of data. Go ahead and discovery pokemon and some of their attributes! You will be able
             to see a list of all viewed pokemon and have the option to ban attributes to remove any pokeomon with a banned attribute!
